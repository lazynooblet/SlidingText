This is a port of my pebble (RIP) watchface of the same name.

Things I'm thinking about adding:
* Swap battery fade configuration, so full battery stands out rather than fades in (by request)
* Investigating how to implement 24-hour time (please send me suggestions!)
* Investigating if this works in other languages (let me know your thoughts!)
